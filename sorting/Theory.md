Sorting algorithms

BubbleSort 
    elements moved up in order like bubbles rising to the surface
    compare each pair of adjacent elements and swap if they are in wrong order.
Insertion sort
    loop through each element and bring the checking element to correct place by moving other elements to backward.

Selection Sort
    seletct the smallest and get it to the front.
    then select next smallest and so on.

Quick sort
    relatively fast algorithm 	O(n*log(n))
    use devide and concure method => 
            1. devide array by half
            2. sort two halves seperately
            3. combine two sorted arrays

merge sort
